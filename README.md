## Project Description
This project is a collaborative effort by Josh Rueter, Irene Guo, Emily Wohlgemuth, and Pranav Praburam. It serves as a documentation repository for the COSI 103A course at Brandeis University. This project is a React-based web application for displaying recipes.

The App.js file is importing various components and recipe data. The components include a Navbar and a Team component, which are used for navigation and displaying information about the team that created the app, respectively.

The recipe data is imported from individual files, each presumably representing a different recipe (e.g., Alfredo, GrilledCheese, Snickerdoodles, etc.).

The Header function component is used to display the header of the application, which includes the name of the app, "K's Kuisine".

The RecipeBoard function component is used to display the recipes.

The application uses react-router-dom for routing, which allows the application to navigate between different components (or pages) without a page refresh.
